## Software

I write software professionally and for fun. Most of my work has revolved around
web development, which means I use quite a lot of JavaScript. I think it would be
fair to label myself a _JavaScript Developer_.

Because I've been at this a while, though, I'm also a full stack developer. I've
done quite a lot with Java (mostly Spring Boot) and CI/CD with AWS.

I love writing clean, optimal and well tested code (ty [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)).

## Disc Golf

I started playing disc golf in 2001 at Silver Creek Park in Manitowoc, WI. I was 18
years old and disc golf was brand new to me. The first time I played, I ran to each
of my lies because I was so excited to throw my next shot. Most people know if they
love disc golf after their first round, and that certainly holds true for me.

Now I play in golf in the Jacksonville, FL area. I play mostly in leagues or for fun,
but I have played some professional golf, with very limited success.
