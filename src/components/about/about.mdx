# Software

I write software professionally and for fun. Most of my work has revolved around
web development, which means I use quite a lot of JavaScript. I think it would be
fair to label myself a _JavaScript Developer_.

Because I've been at this a while, though, I'm also a full stack developer. I've
done quite a lot with Java (mostly Spring Boot) and CI/CD with AWS.

I love writing clean, optimal and well tested code (ty [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)).
