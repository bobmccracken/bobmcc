## Experience

- React

- Spring Boot
- Project Lead
- Manage Overseas Developers

For most of my time at Incentivio I have served as the Lead Developer on our web
ordering app. This is a multi-tenant app used by 100s of restaurants and serving
~200,000 sessions per month. See [Pura Vida
Miami](https://order.incentivio.com/c/puravidamiami), for one example.

The application is written in React. Aside from development, I was responsible
for architecting the application, developing CI/CD processes (GitHub Actions),
and provisioning cloud based infrastructure (AWS CloudFront).

I am most proud of our testing solution which has achieved 100% code coverage,
with the majority of tests written in Cypress.
